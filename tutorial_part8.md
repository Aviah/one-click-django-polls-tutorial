For more info about this project, see the [Project Docs](readme_docs.md).   
The docs have a lot of details about the project layout, settings, media files, imports, logging etc. The nice thing is that you can actually explore the real project, the configs, and see how it works. There are also details how to add some advanced features which are required for any professional web application, like https, CDN etc. 

## A Few More Suggestions

** The Django docs tutorial**    
The official django tutorial covers two additional topics that we didn't cover here: class based views, and testing. The django tutorial also has more details, specificaly about "what not to do". So it's a good idea to check it.

** The Django docs **    
The django official documentation is simply awesome, covers everything in plain and simple language, with a lot of details and examples. 


** Additional Tutorial**    
Kenneth Love has an incredible 3.5 hours long video tutorial from PyCon 2014, see the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZHXjGP71kQ)

** Book **    
Two scoops of django, by Daniel & Audrey Roy Greenfeld.  It's a great book, that covers many issues. This is not a step by step or in depth text, but rather a lot of hints, tips and best practices how to make a better django project. The book is available [here](https://www.twoscoopspress.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-8)


**More Resources **

There are of course many useful and great resources for Django and Python on the web. A notable and comprehensive place to start is [Full Stack Python](http://www.fullstackpython.com/).

Also, any of the DjangoCon videos, always online for free, is a a great place to catch up an issue, or to know the things you don't know that you don't know.

**Advanced**

The Pro Django book by Marty Alchin, the 2nd edition is from 2013. The book is about the core architecture of django, so it's absolutly insightful and relevant.  Gives a good insight to the "zen" of django's, and the fundemental design decisions of the framework. Available [here](http://www.amazon.com/Pro-Django-Experts-Voice-Development/dp/1430258098/ref=dp_ob_title_bk).    
A really useful "companion" book from the same author, Pro Python, available [here](http://www.amazon.com/Pro-Python-J-Burton-Browning-ebook/dp/B00MY0I600/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8)

"Django in Depth", a 3.5 hours long video by James Bernett at PyCon 2015, see the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkwZ1jG3XgA)
